# T3 Digital Credential Wallet

T3 Digital Credential Wallet is a cross-platform iOS and Android mobile application 
for storing and sharing digital learner credentials.

Install [T3 Digital Credential Wallet](https://lcw.app/) for your mobile!

The wallet is based on the [T3 Digital Credential Wallet specification](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/docs/Learner-Credential-Wallet-Specification-May-2021.pdf) developed by the [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/). The T3 Digital Credential Wallet specification is based on the draft [W3C Universal Wallet interoperability specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/) and the draft [W3C Verifiable Credentials data model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/).

The app has been compiled for iOS and Android and allows users to add and share credentials, as well as manage the wallet.

## Goals
This T3 Digital Credential Wallet includes the features and technical requirements 
ultimately enabling individuals to curate and present their learning and 
employment records to others — for example, as applicants to educational programs 
or to apply for jobs with employers—in an interoperable manner. 

## Features
* Receive digital credentials from standards compliant issuers via link or QR code
* Store credentials on their mobile device
* Keep credential access safe with strong encryption best practices
* Create and share a presentation that collates any number of credentials in their wallet
* Backup and restore their wallet

# Development Setup

## Installation

**If you encounter any issues, visit the [Troubleshooting Page](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/learner-credential-wallet/wiki/Troubleshooting)**

### Dependencies
Prerequisites:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
* [nvm](https://collabnix.com/how-to-install-and-configure-nvm-on-mac-os/) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started)
* [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) (use brew, not gem, to install)
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

See [Installing on Linux](install-linux.md) on setting up the project on Linux.

### Setup of the LCW App
1. Clone this repository or `git pull`
2. In root of project, run `npm install` to install the React Native dependencies.
   * (Optionally, if you use the `asdf` version manager run `asdf install` to install - more info in asdf section below)
3. Run `npm run prebuild:ios` and `npm run prebuild:android` to set up the `ios` and `android` folders. This step uses [Expo prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/).

#### *If using asdf*
* Run `asdf install` to install the proper versions of the technologies used listed in the `.tool-versions` file
  * If you need to install anything, run `asdf plugin add [plugin-name]` to add it to your local machine
  * Here is a link if you need it to the [asdf installation documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#getting-started) _(homebrew is the easiest)_

### Running the LCW App
1) Run `yarn start` in one terminal
2) In another terminal run `yarn android`
  * When running on android, open Android Studio and make sure the device you want to run on is selected (whether that is an emulator or a real device). 
  * Note: You might need to hit the play button in Android Studio for it to fully register which device to set to be used from the command line.
3) In another terminal yarn `yarn ios`


## Environment

This project uses **TypeScript and React Native with [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)**. It would be best to use an 
editor that can hook into the TypeScript language server (VSCode does this with Intellisense, Vim does it with CoC). We also use eslint to catch common mistakes and formatting errors. Most editors should support dynamic linting support while editing. If your editor does not, you can manually lint by running `npm run lint` in the project root.

This project also uses **environment variables**, which are loaded and used in `app.config.js`. These values can be overridden, but development values should not be committed to the repository.

```

## Configuration

Overridable configuration is in [`app.config.js`](./app.config.js)

### If forking this project to customize your own version of the LCW, please note the following: 

* Setting up your own storage server is **strongly** encouraged. This storage server takes the role of verifying credentials added to the LCW. The `VERIFIER_INSTANCE_URL` can be updated in `app.config.js` as mentioned in the Environment section above.

* The bundle identifier for your customized project will need to be updated in `ios` and `android` directories for Apple and Google app stores, respectively, if deploying to production.  The display name in `app.config.js`, as well names under the `expo` section will need to be checked before deploying to app stores.
   - iOS: For iOS, check your target value inside your Podfile
   - Android: For Android, check that the rootProject.name in your `android/settings.gradle` is up-to-date.

### Issuing new credential

Instructions for issuing a credential are [here](https://github.com/digitalcredentials/docs/blob/main/credential/issue_credential.md). 

### Adding new credential display

A custom display can be created for different credentials, to do so:

- Create a new React component for your credential type in 
  [app/components/CredentialCard/](app/components/CredentialCard/) - 
  eg. `app/components/CredentialCard/YourNewTypeCard.tsx`
- Define addition styles in `app/components/CredentialCard/YourNewTypeCard.styles.tsx`
- Add a function to the `credentialTypes` list defined in 
  [app/components/CredentialCard/CredentialCard.tsx](app/components/CredentialCard/CredentialCard.tsx). 
  The function should return `{component: YourNewCredentialCard, title: 'the title of the credential that should be used when listing it elsewhere'}` or null if the credential isn't the appropriate type for you custom display
- **note**: the list will be scanned for the first function that returns a 
  component and title, so it's important that the type check is specific and 
  doesn't match any other types.

   - iOS: Enable VoiceOver in Settings
   - Android: Enable TalkBack in Settings
   - Navigate through the app using swipe gestures

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Connect external keyboard
   - Use Tab/Shift+Tab to navigate
   - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable

3. **Visual Testing**:

   - Check color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards

### Development Guidelines

When contributing to the project, ensure accessibility by:

- Adding `accessibilityLabel` to all interactive elements
- Using `accessibilityHint` for complex interactions
- Setting appropriate `accessibilityRole` values
- Testing with screen readers during development
- Maintaining minimum color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
